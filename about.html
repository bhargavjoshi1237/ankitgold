  Radhika Jewellers is a brand that is coveted for its trust and promise of crafting unprecedented designs in the most spectacular pieces. Our exemplary work of craftsmanship spans more than 3 decades where Mr. Ashok Zinzuwadia along with his father Mr. Mathurbhai Zinzuwadia laid the strong foundation for Radhika Jewellers way back in 1987. The journey started with a small shop of 200 sq. ft. with 7 employees. The house stacked approx. 15 kg of gold jewellery at that time. In 1995, Mr. Ashok's brother, Mr. Haresh Zinzuwadia joined the family business and they both took the business to the next level of excellence.

  Radhika Jewellers became a Public Limited company with effect from 22nd July 2016 with blessings from their Father. The brand is listed on Bombay Stock Exchange & National Stock exchange under the name of Radhika Jeweltech Ltd.
  
  Mr. Ashok Zinzuwadia and Mr. Haresh Zinzuwadia built a sterling reputation in the industry and today their business soars to the upper echelon of the Saurashtra and Gujarat region. Mr. Ashok and Mr. Haresh believed that when you have something exceptional along with top-notch quality and humble after-sales service, customers are enticed to come to you, and this is where "Trust" became the biggest element in Radhika Jewellersâ€™ success. They believed that building a strong bond with the customers is fundamental in creating a legacy along with the right amount of business acumen.
  
  The journey from 1987 to 2022, from a small establishment in Soni Bazar at Rajkot to a 2,500 sq ft showroom at Palace Road, Rajkot, and the coming new 10,000 sq. ft showroom at Kalawad Road, Rajkot captures the passion, commitment, courage, strength, and optimism that brand stands for.
  
  The brand has since then grown rapidly and established a reputation for Indian Gold and Diamond jewelry with exquisite craftsmanship and magnificent jewelry creations. Over the decades, Radhika Jewellers showcased an exclusive style made with pure gold and elegant designs that exquisitely balanced volumes and unmistakable motifs that pay homage to the ancient roots of the company. While always reverting to its cultural legacy, Radhika Jewellers introduced innovations that sparkled in the world of the jewelry industry and launched novel trends that stood out as icons of contemporary design.
